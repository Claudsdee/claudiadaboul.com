                <h2> Right first time: Documentation Improvements </h2>
                <p>Imagine working in a fast-paced production environment. Add on top of
                that, recording information correctly 100% of the time all the time.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The struggle is <span class="Bitalic">REAL</span> for production
                operators. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Because in reality? The percentage of recording information right first time
                (RFT) was only at 60%. And this number greatly affected their key performance indicators</p>
                <br>
                <p>What could be done to increase the RFT%?</p>
                <br>
                <p>First the documents where the production operators were reviewed and
                it was determined where the majority of the errors occurred. Once the
                data was trended and the insights made, a meeting was held with the
                head of production to organise collaboration sessions with the
                production operators to see how they feel with the current documents
                and to see if the documents could be made better with ideas from the
                production operators. </p>
                <br>
                <p>I printed out the documents that the operators would use daily and gave them to the production operators to scribble on and make notes. I then took those notes and updated the documents with those changes. </p>
                <br>
                <p><span class="Bitalic">Outcome?</span></p>
                <p>The right first time percentage did not reach 100, but getting scores of up to 96% each month was a major improvement for the production operators and they were proud of themselves and the documents as they were able to improve things for themselves.</p>
